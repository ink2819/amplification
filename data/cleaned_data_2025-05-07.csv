(sulaj)  while elaborating on the image of the bull being stabbed, he says about refugees that flee, “war makers use people to fight in war, and afterward, they kill them.” just as happened in iraq, says hussein, “they said, ‘we are coming to save the iraqi people’.” after a quiet pause, he adds, “it’s just politics”. “they didn’t find anything dangerous in iraq. it was all a lie.""<br><br>in the painting, the donkey’s head is the mask of democracy, while the elephant in the party scene is the republican. “again, i use it in the painting because they said they were bringing us democracy. in the exodos painting, titled ‘extreme’ the light bulb under an umbrella expresses, what was promised to iraq: “ we are coming here to bring the light to create a paradise on earth”. hussein painted the scene to have it appear that the figures are outside, but they are not outside, because the characters are fenced in. he says, “inside the world of this painting, the fence where the refugees are contained, is not as the barbed wire of refugee or palestinian fences, it is an american picket fence.""<br></p>",2018,"<p>the painting was made in the artist's host country: boston, mass. u.s.a.</p>",imagery,85 x 63 in.,Painting,,English,Rights Remain With Artist,,,mitli-mitlak-like-you-like-me-exhibition,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660437127c5c859535a8161c/66ffbad39813991f2c212bda_extreme1.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,99.0,False,,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660437127c5c859535a8161c/66ffbad39813991f2c212bda_extreme1.webp,Massachusetts,Iraq,Lebanon,
