In the text, a character named Ruba experiences the destruction of war first hand and becomes a refugee in the process. The use of imagery and of violence evokes the emotional and physical vulnerability of certain Mediterranean themes...such as being without asylum. <br><br>In Sinan Hussein’s refugee paintings, the heaviness and the trauma of these experiences are constructed with powerful symbols that are very small, colorful, humble, yet extreme. He condenses three scenes into one or two paintings through symbolism. In Hussein’s refugee painting, the refugee is wearing a red glove on one hand, which for Hussein, is a symbol of politics: the glove of communism. He describes it as ‘how they amass people and tell them that all are treated equally, whether they are rich or poor...the same, animal or not animal, all the same herd. The zebra head worn by one figure is a symbol of world politics. This painting situates Mitli Mitlak during a civil war. One character has on yellow boots, worn when someone goes out to catch fish. “He is going out to kill; Kill the fish... Kill somebody...Kill”. What is being killed in the painting is a bull, reminding the viewer of the Spanish bullfights. This sacrificial animal is symbolizing refugee people. This stabbed, bludgeoned bull attached to and being wheeled around on a bicycle tire, reduces the refugee exodos to one symbol or image. (SULAJ)  While elaborating on the image of the bull being stabbed, he says about refugees that flee, “War makers use people to fight in war, and afterward, they kill them.” Just as happened in Iraq, says Hussein, “they said, ‘we are coming to save the Iraqi people’.” After a quiet pause, he adds, “It’s just politics”. “They didn’t find anything dangerous in Iraq. It was all a lie.""<br><br>In the painting, the donkey’s head is the mask of democracy, while the elephant in the party scene is the republican. “Again, I use it in the painting because they said they were bringing us democracy. In the exodos painting, titled ‘Extreme’ The light bulb under an umbrella expresses, what was promised to Iraq: “ We are coming here to bring the light to create a paradise on earth”. Hussein painted the scene to have it appear that the figures are outside, but they are not outside, because the characters are fenced in. He says, “Inside the world of this painting, the fence where the refugees are contained, is not as the barbed wire of refugee or Palestinian fences, It is an American picket fence.""<br></p>",2018,"<p>The painting was made In the artist's host country: Boston, Mass.

A refugee with colonized traits resembling a spirit from the 1800’s, is with people in his heart that give him happiness, even in the predicament of losing all. In his hands, a dead child. It seems this character is very confused...very far from himself. He seems to have worked so hard to create a Western appearance, and he seems to deny that his goals are destroyed and unattainable. He does not know himself, only the mediatized personality which he has created as a defense mechanism. He is posing for the camera with the dead child in hand. All accepting Mary enshrines him. The weeping creatures out of her hands are swollen flowers who are burnt out and exhausted.

When I am inspired by the streets I create something new,"" says Nagy.<br><br>In Act 1, Scene 2, Mitli Mitlak (Like You, Like Me), this series of photos depicts the view from the window of a young couple’s apartment during war. Much like Nagy, the couple in Mitli Mitlak are poetic young artists who apply their own experiences during the war in the hopes that their art will enable truth to shine through the cracks of every day chaotic reality:<br><br>Act 1, Scene 2, Mitli Mitlak (Like You, Like Me)<br><br>Carlos: as the disappearance of reality...when there is no ruling body...the disappearance of our objectified self because ...the nonexistent social field. Our subjectivity is all there is...We collide in time. A deep meaning can arise when society is broken by war.<br><br>Ruba: (singing) Reality is not functioning. There is no social field. Watermoon. Thoughts in silence. Ideas of collective memories, global thinking overviews. Points of view. Watermoon. In my mind..on opaque screen...horizontality explained by the sea; writing on the water.

In the text, a character named Ruba experiences the destruction of war first hand and becomes a refugee in the process. <br><br>Murad is clear, “Most important to my people are the borders coming off.” Likewise, Ruba, as represented by Murad, urgently needs to be free. She longs to shed the manufactured boundaries of well-guarded concrete crowned with razor wire, along with the ‘norms’ of modern existence that wrap chainlink around her life’s trajectory. “Ruba is close to me and represents Arab women in a universal way. Ruba is within all people. She wants to go out, to be free, to talk, to just make any move that could change her life. When I initially began, I wanted to paint the state of all people wanting freedom.” Within Ruba, ‘borders are coming off’ where phantasms, night visions, and apparitions are manifesting in the space around her. Ruba is experiencing the faraway world as she simultaneously feels like a stranger to herself. Her remoteness makes it seem that she has no friend, as she embodies visions from her third eye:<br><br>Act 1, Scene 1<br><br>Ruba: (Twirling with high voices) Maaa Maaa! Maaa Maaa! Maaa! Maaa! (She becomes a mermaid at sea. She is laying on a rock, calling and calling to the ships with a siren-like voice). (Ruba sits up and writes passionately in her diary. The writing is moving her arm...it is writing alone.) (Ruba normalizes rapidly. She is moving happily through the space).<br><br>Murad made the paintings in Flower Of Freedom (Separated From Every Garden), by first taking photographs of herself with a cell phone near a hanging light bulb, in a room where she slept, painted, and ate. One year later, Murad fled Palestine, became a refugee, and is now exiled in Paris, France.<br><br>(Above text taken from an essay in the exhibition catalogue, Mitli Mitlak (Like You, Like Me), which provides an overview of contemporary Arab world art and current regional and global trends of thought, and also illustrates the interrelations between Biba Sheikh’s literary text and each visual artist’s work, as it relates to the exhibition).</p>",2018,"<p>Gaza, Palestine</p>","Gaza, Palestine","31.3547 , 34.3088",Palestine,,,,imagery,,,,English,Rights Remain With Artist,,,mitli-mitlak-like-you-like-me-exhibition,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660437127c5c859535a8161c/66ffd301db02fb859ed913a5_flower-1.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,37,FALSE,

There are hundreds of John and Jane Does - countless men, women and children - who are lying in unmarked graves, and likely hundreds more whose bodies are never recovered, as they attempt to cross the border into the USA. This tragic situation brought about by today’s lack of social responsibility, unity and humanity is brought to light in this solemn presentation addressing the plight of those thousands of immigrants crossing borders around the world, whose bodies and bones are discovered partially turned to dust along the border. The 60' circle, composed of white plaster cast body parts is reminiscent of the sun-bleached remains represent those faceless and unidentified who perished in their struggle to find a refuge for themselves and their families.

This exhibition is funded by the Centre for Applied Social Research (CeASR), Leeds Beckett University ","<p>‘Asylum in Art’ is a photo-narrative exhibition taking the audience on an experiential tour of lived reality. Asylum in Art shines a lens on what life is like inside a British Immigration Removal Centre (IRC) and beyond release into a community in Leeds, West Yorkshire. <br><br>The exhibition is a photo-narrative of 11 photographs visualising the primary narrative research of Maria De Angelis in photographs by Jeremy Abrahams. At its heart, photo-narrative captures the tension between the institutional IRC (tasked with detaining and deporting those without papers) and the gendered, cultural, human face of detainees hidden away inside it. Using a photo-narrative method, the exhibition reflects key narratives across detention experience: Amongst them - a lack of institutional legitimacy; its modern slavery typology; its carceral practices, its netting of poor people of colour; counter-conduct and belonging both within and beyond IRC walls. Due to women’s ongoing asylum claims, women did not want to feature in their own photographs. Therefore, to protect participants, all the actors are students or colleagues from Leeds Beckett University. <br><br>Asylum in Art is a collaborative project with Critical Friends from City of Sanctuary; Refugee Education Training Advice Service (RETAS); Toast-Love-Coffee café; Asmarina Voices; Hinsley Hall; and Universities Chaplaincy in Leeds. It is based on the collective experience of 15 former detainees - truly remarkable women whose generous sharing of stories has made the exhibition possible. Given that women cannot take photos inside these Centres, photographs are artistic representations of key lived moments, as narrated by women, and negotiated between women, critical friends, researcher, and photographer in the attempt to show the experience the women wished to tell. As it takes the audience on an experiential tour into the lived reality of detainees, it becomes an interactive process.

Through storytelling and illustration of ethnographic data from research conducted in British immigration detention centres by Sarah Turnbull and Joanne Vincett, it also aims to innovate in how research is disseminated and shared both within and beyond academia. <br><br>There is a lack of public awareness that the Home Office regularly detains foreign nationals and those seeking asylum “on the spot”, without notifying them how long they will remain detained or if they will be released or removed/deported from the UK. Mental health issues developed from confinement and uncertainty are further compounded by the Home Office’s policy to detain people without a maximum time limit. <br><br>The narrative and illustration crafted in this project draw on a visual-tactile aspect of how people cope with immigration detention and resist its damage to their mental health that both Sarah and Jo observed in their separate ethnographic research projects. The practice of origami art (paper folding) in immigration detention was found to be particularly prevalent amongst female detainees in Yarl’s Wood Immigration Removal Centre. “Art as resistance” is a story of how detained women practice origami art, and transfer this knowledge to new arrivers, to counter the harmful effects of immigration detention on detained people and their families.<br><br>For more on this project, see: <br></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Online project profile via The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.open.ac.uk/ikd/research/migration-forced-displacement/art-resistance-story-immigration-detention"" id="""">http://www.open.ac.uk/ikd/research/migration-forced-displacement/art-resistance-story-immigration-detention</a>, August 2019&nbsp;</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id="""">The Open University Research news article, 8 October 2019, <a href=""http://www.open.ac.uk/research/news/new-creative-resource-engaging-public-about-mental-health-and-immigration-detention"" id="""">http://www.open.ac.uk/research/news/new-creative-resource-engaging-public-about-mental-health-and-immigration-detention</a></li></ul><ul id=""""><li id="""">Blog via Border Criminologies at University of Oxford, Oxford, UK, (<a href=""https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2020/01/public-engagement"" id="""">https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2020/01/public-engagement</a>), 10 January 2020.</li></ul>",2019,"<p>London and Milton Keynes, UK</p>","London, UK","51.5072 , -0.1276",UK,"Milton Keynes, UK","52.0406, -0.7594",,pdf,,,,English,,,,,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660437127c5c859535a8161c/670e6b51e7afa4bf363cb5bd_Art-as-Resistance.webp,,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660437127c5c859535a8161c/66ffd4d48088bb0ec892748e_art-as-resistance.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,16,FALSE,

He has established himself as a pioneer of such technology as the ROLI Seaboard (a keyless keyboard), and has collaborated on a wide variety of works in film, television, animation, dance, music, and art installation. Spurred by his diverse background in the arts and technology, Aashray envisions future projects that will bring together artists and scientists alike to tackle solutions to real-world problems through a combination of creative and technical thinking. His newest project, “Ashrama”, is an immersive installation piece that explores the idea of refuge and the basic need of all humans to be sheltered and cared for. It explores refuge as it exists in our environment, in people, nature, things, ideas, music, dance, technology, etc. The project explores both the physical and mental need for comfort and shelter from the chaos of the world around us, and aims to open our eyes, ears, hearts, minds, and bodies to the lives of others, to their struggles and refuges. “Ashrama” eventually intends to deliver tangible change to those who are without refuge, whether physical or mental. It aims to not only bring awareness but to support those who are literally or emotionally unhoused, to give them a refuge to re-balance and revitalize their life energy.",,"Refuge, Installation, Art, CalArts, Sound Art, Tapestry, Projection Art",refuge; installation; art; calarts; sound-art; tapestry; projection-art,150,FALSE,
